### App Idea
I would like to develop an app that connects consumers in the Philippines to small businesses that may not necessarily be local to their area. Many small businesses in the Philippines specialize in traditional and regional arts, crafts, and cuisine. Features would include being able to filter through businesses based on their region/province, what kind of specialty, proximity, etc. The interfaces will be different based on whether they are a consumer or a small business owner. Small businesses can customize their own page to showcase their goods and communicate with consumers through the platform--and potentially provide shipping options. Consumers can view a map to see if there are any businesses near the area that they would like to support and leave reviews on the respective business' page after their experience.

## Notes

Navigating the Xcode IDE was a challenge due to all the different features. Using Git with Xcode's interface was also a new experience since it took a while to figure out how to commit directly to GitHub, as well as where to create a new branch--nonetheless, it's convenient considering how Git is integrated into the IDE.
